        <h2 class="h2">Research through different websites</h2>
        <p class="p2">To buid this website, I went through different websites and observe different designs of those websites. Some of the main designs of different websites which inspire me to buid same type of design in my website are compared below:</p>
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column_1">
            <img src="images/R1.png" alt="R1" style="width:100%">
          </div>
          <div class="column_1">
            <img src="images/R2.png" alt="R2" style="width:100%">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="p2"> The left side image is the picture of Home page of website from which I have took the design of navigation bar along with the texts on the left side of home page.<br><br>
          The navigation bar of left image website is on the right side of page along with the logo of the owner name and with little information of ownself. Just like the left website, there is navigation bar in right side of page with portfolio logo in top left corner of page and some texts on my introduction on left side of page.
          But different from website of left side there is text effect/animation in home page of my website. And also some media icons in bottom of texts from which viewer can directly connect with my social media accounts.
        </p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="column_1">
                <img src="images/R3.png" alt="R3" style="width:100%">
                </div>
            <div class="column_1">
                <img src="images/R4.png" alt="R4" style="width:100%">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="p2"> The left side image is the picture of Blog page of website from which I have took the format of placing pictures along with the texts on the bottom side of picture in blog page.<br><br>
          Like the website on the left side image there is picture placed at the top of texts which explains the title situated in the bottom of the picture. But im my website there is Date in the bottom left corner of picture and also pictures hiver when pointer is placed over picture.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column_1">
                <img src="images/R5.png" alt="R5" style="width:100%">
            </div>
            <div class="column_1">
                <img src="images/R6.png" alt="R6" style="width:100%">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="p2"> The left side image is the picture of Contact page of website from which I have took the format of placing media icons along with the contact form on the bottom side of media icons in contact page.<br><br>
          There are media icons on the left side of contact form in left side of website contact page but In contact page of my website, there is media icons on the top of contact form and also the media icons have hover effect when pointer is placed over icons.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column_1">
              <img src="images/R7.png" alt="R7" style="width:100%">
            </div>
            <div class="column_1">
              <img src="images/R8.png" alt="R8" style="width:100%">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="p2"> The left side image is the picture of About page of website from which I have took the format of placing my picture along with the some texts about me on the right side of my picture in Home page.<br><br>
            In the website of left image size of picture is large ani also place on the right side while texts are placed on left side in About page. But in my website picture is medium in size and placed on the left side of page while texts are placed on right side of Home page.
          </p>
               <div class="row">
                <div class="column_1">
                  <img src="images/R9.png" alt="R9" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <div class="column_1">
                  <img src="images/R10.png" alt="R10" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              </div>
          <p class="p2"> The left side image is the picture of Cv page of website from which I have took the format of CV  in CV page.<br><br>
            As like the website of left image the format of CV is same in my website but i remove some of the headings and also added the line bar to represent the skills I have with different colors along with percentage of skills.
